# Oh-my-linux

Include all my linux configuration files, like i3, zsh, vim and so on. Will add one by one.

Linux distribution: **ArchLinux** or **Manjaro**  
Arch: 64bit

## Fonts

To make the VIM, tmux and terminal beautiful, [powerline-fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) is necessary.  

In Arch or Manjaro, just install with below command:  
```shell
yaourt -S powerline powerline-fonts
```

## VIM configuration

Personal VIM configuration for VIM8.1, tested under CentOS environment.

This configuration most foucus on Golang development.

## GIT

Currently only add 3 sections: global user info, credential, alias.  

For GIT, I mainly focus on `git log` command which can make so beautiful & readable, until I find a good tool [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig).  
In Arch, you can install it by `yaourt -S tig`. It is awesome, suggested to try.
